### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Murat.

I'm a coder (I call myself with this title) and I'm not yet a superstar in the league of software development, but I can be a great team player on the road to championship. Beside this, I like to drawing, :beer:, :fried_shrimp: and every genre of movie :movie_camera:.

- ğŸ’› My crush: NodeJS(javaScript)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin
